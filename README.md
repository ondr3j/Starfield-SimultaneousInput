## ‚öô Requirements

  - Add this to your `PATH` during installtion/updating
- [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/latest)
- [Vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)
  - Set the `VCPKG_ROOT` environment variable to the path of the vcpkg folder

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Get started

### üíª Register Visual Studio as a Generator

- Open `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt`
- Run `cmake`
- Close the cmd window

### üì¶ Dependencies

- [DKUtil](https://github.com/gottyduke/DKUtil)
- LibStarfield

These dependencies can be configured through the git submodule by running `update-submodule.bat`. Alternatively, the dependencies can also use a local git repository, by setting the `DKUtilPath` environment variable to the path of the local git repository.

In order to enable local git repository lookup, existing folders within `extern` should be **removed**.

> To prevent duplicating submodules in multiple local projects, it's recommended to clone the DKUtil repositories locally. Then, set the environment path accordingly, this ensures all projects share the same package.  

### üî® Building

```
.\make-sln-msvc.bat
cmake --build build --config Release
```
A Visual Studio solution will be generated inside `build` folder.

### ‚ûï Addon
